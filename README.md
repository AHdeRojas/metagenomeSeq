metagenomeSeq
=============

Statistical analysis for sparse high-throughput sequencing


metagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it Operational Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, etc.) 
that are differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple samples. metagenomeSeq is designed 
to address the effects of both normalization and under-sampling of microbial communities on disease 
association detection and the testing of feature correlations.
