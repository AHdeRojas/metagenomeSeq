versions 1.1.5 (2013-06-11) 

Changed thanks to Kasper Daniel Hansen's suggestions the following:

	plotOTU and plotGenus both have much better auto-generated axis
	MRtable, MRfulltable, MRcoefs have a sort by p-value option now
	MRtable, MRfulltable, MRcoefs now have an extra option to include unique numbers for OTU features (default would automatically add them previously)

Still need to turn the fitZig output to S3, consider subsetting function address low p-values

versions 1.1.3 (2013-06-01) 

Changed thanks to Kasper Daniel Hansen's suggestions the following:

	cumNorm.R - now returns the object as well - not just replacing the environment

version 1.0.0: (2013-03-29)

	-- release!
